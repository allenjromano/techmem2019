# 2.2 Mnemotechnics

## Before class

#### Read

Borges, *Funes, His Memory*: [http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf)


Optional:
Though we are not reading it in its entirety, Luria's[ _Mind of a Mnemonist_](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-mystery-of-s-the-man-with-an-impossible-memory) is the classic work.  This case study inspired numerous works of fiction and imaginings about what it would be like to live with the most full of memories. The [full book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674576223) is a quick read and well worth it.
