# Digital Exhibitions

The assignment before class builds on the visit to the FSU Heritage Museum on Tuesday. If you were not in class on Tuesday, then you should first stop by the FSU Heritage Museum in Dodd Hall (first floor, open from 10 am to 4 pm each day). Two tasks while there: 1. Take a look around the whole space and think about how the materials in that room present a picture of FSU's past and present. What choices makr the inclusion/exclusion of materials? What story does the museum tell about FSU. and 2. Find an individual artifact or exhibit within the museum. What role does memory play in how that particular object is displayed or in the effect that object has. What kinds of choices have to be made about displaying that particular artifact. How does the visitor relate to or interact with that object?

Response prompt: Complete before class and bring to class:
Write up your notes/responses to the questions about the objects in the FSU museum. We discussed the Museum in general in class, so it would make sense to focus especially on the object you studied, but you can also relate that specific object to how the past of FSU is presented in the Museum as a whole. Where does this object fit in? Is it similar or different from other objects?
