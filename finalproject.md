# Portfolio Revision

The last assignment (aka "project") is fairly straightforward:
Use your existing entries as seed material; grow something new from what you have already done.

1. Review all your portfolio assignments. Are there particular threads or ideas that run across some of them? Are there ideas from later work that seem applicable to earlier work? What themes do you see?

2. Are there particular ones (or maybe a few) that you would really like to develop further or that would benefit from more time, revision, and attention?

3. In either case, you should have some pre-existing material which can serve as the basis for something new. Take that existing material, whether it is an existing entry/artifact or whether it is simply a set of threads and themes, and revise, extend, amplify, and augment it into something new. You can, for example, add more material into consideration of what was originally focused on a particular artifact. 

4. As this is fairly flexible and I am focused more on process than anything else, the requirement for sufficient length or scope is simply that it take in a significant swath of the material we have looked at all term and that it be a significant elaboration of what you have done previously. It does not need to tie up everything in a neat bow, but it should show familiarity with the wide range of topics, ideas, and works that we have covered. 

You are encouraged to do this over this last week, as a sort of retrospectie and in place of whatever time you would have spent studying for a final exam (were this the kind of class that had a final exam). It is due, technically, at the end of exam week, simply so that I can have time to submit final grades. However, you are encouraged to get it in before then. 

Submit, along with all of your portfolio materials to date, this new artifact either physically (diff 434) or via canvas inbox (i.e. email) if applicable. You can have the physical materials back anytime after final grades are in. If your previous artifacts are in a form that can't be easily removed or handed over, then feel free to submit an image or scan. For mixed media, the easiest way to submit things is to make everything digital, stick it in a folder, zip or compress the folder, and then send me the zip file.
