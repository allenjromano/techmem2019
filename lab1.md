# Lab 1

## Overview
In this part of the course we tackle the issues we have been reading about in a more hands on way. You are asked to experiment with a technology, both current and retro, in order to ask and try to answer questions about how technology shapes our view of the world around us. 

For this first assignment, we look at the kinds of interfaces we use to interact with computers and with the internet. For many people, the monitor is, for all practical purposes, the same as the computer. When using a phone, on the other hand, icons are the interface. For the early history of computing, interacting with a computer may have meant the warm green glow of a command line or, even before that, a stack of punch cards fed into a large machine. 

You are asked here to do a bit of reading for context and then to spend the majority of your time experimenting with various technologies in order to answer the question: what difference does the way we access a computer make for how we view the world at large?
