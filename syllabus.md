# Technologies of Memory
## Syllabus

### Overview
This course questions the world through the overlap of three areas: technology studies, memory studies, and literary studies. 

### Requirements
This course is designed as a seminar. The basic activities are therefore those of reading, writing, class activities and discussion, and a series of projects. All of these assingments have as a basic goal deepening your understanding of the past, literature, culture, and history; however, well beyond that basic goal the primary aim of this course is to involve students in an ongoing conversation about the nature of memory and technology and to equip students with the ability to think about "big ideas", both past and present, in an informed and critical way. 

The course workflow is straightforward:
1. Read or view some stuff in preparation for each class. (This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on the lenght of the reading).
2. Produce a small amount of verbiage in response to a prompt or other form of assignment connected to what you've viewed. (Typically, no more than 10 minutes.)
3. Come to class prepared to work with the material you read/viewed/thought about.
4. Do stuff during class.
5. At least once per week, add an entry to your portfolio
6. Every third week, do the memtech lab assignment. 
7. In the final weeks of the class, revise and augment one of your portfolio entries or labs into a more substantial online project (or research "paper"). 

Each of these parts will be explained below. For now, note that this is a class that requires regular but not extensively time-consuming attention. There are, therefore, no high stakes tests. There is no midterm and no final exam.

### Grading
I hate grading. There, I said it. Let's get it out there. I hate grading for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that grading is a deeply problematic way of conveying expectatiouns and rewards to students. At this stage, it has become a system to be gamed or figured out, an impediment to one's career or life goals, and, for professors, a logistical nightmare. It is also, a very recent sort of system (letter grading being a phenomenon of the past 100 years or so), a system routed in classism and misguided elitism (see xyz for references). 

With all that said, it is also inescapable. So, let me be clear about what I want to convey with a grading system. My only interest is in people learning something in this class. Therefore, the only use of the graidng system is to help with that. To that extent, grades can be a helpful nudge or bit of light pressure to keep us going when we otherwise might want to do something else. The basic work of this class invovles reading, writing, and showing up. the magic grading formula for the class is therefore this. If you do all these things -- just do them all -- and you get an A.
