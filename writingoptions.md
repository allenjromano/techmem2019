# Options for portfolio assignments

One of the goals of the portfolio assignment each week is to provide an excuse to experiment with how different technologies for communicating may shape your ways of thinking and knowing about the world. For example, do you think differently when you write on a computer vs. with pen and paper? Does a pencil (erasable) vs. a pen change the way you communicate? What happens when you type on a typewriter rather than input your words into a computer? How might communicating about, e.g., Plato via texting or instagram post be a different way of thinking than writing an essay? There are no limitations to how you exercise your creativity in this exercise. The only metric is how much you engage with the material and with the questions raised by that material. 

## Variants on "writing"

You can vary the medium and tools/technology as you like. Some examples:
Pen and paper: fountain pen, quill, pencil; parchment, notebook, legal pads, napkins, bronze tablets

Machine-typed text: computer, phone, typewriter, "vintage" computer (dust off that Apple 2e...); different programs (i.e. distraction-free writing, anything that isn't MS Word: vim, emacs, code editors, draftin.com, LaTeX, google docs, etc.)

Websites of various sorts

audio recordings, video recordings of all sorts

## Variants on how you do exposition and anlysis

Presentation tools: (reflect carefully on what you get out of each type): slides.com, powerpoint and its clones, prezi and its clones

Visualization tools: storymapjs, timelinejs, plotly, bar charts and graphs, any form of quantification; R or python analyses
