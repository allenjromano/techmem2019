# University Policies

### University Attendance Policy

Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.

### Academic Honor Policy

The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students' academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to "...be honest and truthful and... [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University." (For more details see the FSU Academic Honor Policy and procedures for addressing alleged violations.)



### Americans With Disabilities Act

 Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center and (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from the Student Disability Resource Center has been provided. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request. For more information about services available to FSU students with disabilities, contact the:

### Syllabus Change Policy

 "Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the evaluation (grading) statement, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice."
  Course-Specific Policies

###  Multiple Submission Policy:

  You may not submit any work completed for credit in this course for credit in another course; you may not submit for this course that has previously been submitted for credit in another course at any level at any institution.

   

###  Sexual Harassment Policy

   It is the policy of the University that its employees and students neither commit nor condone sexual harassment in any form.  http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/grad/info/university_notices.htm

### Video Use and Course Materials
    
    All the course materials for this course are the intellectual property of the instructor, the teaching assistant, or FSU. They may not be distributed or published in any form without the written consent of the content creator. Videos from the course may not be distributed or reproduced in any form. In order to respect the privacy of your peers, any group work, assignments shared with the class, and video chats or group collaboration sessions are also not to be distributed or published outside of the course. Failure to abide by any of these guidelines will result in an F for the course.


### Technology Policy
    
*Device-free class time: phones silent or off; laptops away*
    
     In general, our class time will be free of devices and personal computers. This may sound ironic, given the topic of the course, but it is a necessary feature of the class if we want to focus on the material at hand. Make any calls, respond to any texts, and generally deal with any electronic business before our class starts each day; make sure no one expects to get in touch with you until our class is over.
    
     For times when we will need to use technology in class, I will specifically mark out that time.


### Minimum technology requirements outside of Class
    
For your work outside of class, in order to complete assignments, you will need a minimum of technology:
    
- Working computer with reliable internet access
- Access to Canvas and FSU libraries (accessible with your FSU ID)
    
Resources for this are available at the library. For any additional technical work, students will be able to use either library resources and/or the PIH digital humanities lab if needed.

### Lateness Policy

The Lateness policy is stated on the syllabus under grading. As a reminder here:
    
Late assignments lose points exponentially. The first few are negligble, but a pattern of chronic lateness or neglecting assignments will result in severe grade penalties as laid out on the syllabus.
    
For chronic issues or chronic illness, get in touch with me as soon as is feasible.

## Plagiarism
    
          Zero Tolerance Plagiarism and Academic Malfeasance Policy
    
          All work you submit for this course must be your own. This includes all assignments in any media, including video, audio, powerpoint, or any other in addition to written work. All work will be run through plagiarism checking software and I reserve the right to examine work in any medium for plagiarism at any point in the course.
    
          Any submission that shows any evidence of plagiarism or being not the work of the student will result in zero credit for the assignment and a failing grade for the course.
    
          Let me repeat that. Anything you submit must be your own work. I would rather read your stuff, even if it is low quality in your mind, then apparently “good” stuff that is done by someone else. If there is evidence that something is not your work, no matter how small the infraction, then that is an automatic failure for the course.
    
          You do not need to plagiarize. If for any reason, at any point, you think you need to plagiarize or find yourself ready to pass off something else as your own work, then drop what you are doing and send me a message instead. I’ll do a plagiarism prevention hotline if you like. There is another way. Usually the apparent need to plagiarize boils down to something else, e.g. didn’t have time to do the assignment, fear that it won’t be good enough, not quite understanding the assignment. Those are things we can deal with and work with and you will end up better off when we’re done. Plagiarism is a dead end.


Explanation: In our increasingly digitized world, one of the issues we will deal with at various points in this course is how we get information about our particular subject matter (basically, the entirety of western civilization, arts, literature, and culture) nowadays. It is an important theme of the course that we live now in an age of information abundance in a way that is fundamentally different from the worldview of antiquity or the Middle Ages. There’s nothing inherently evil about Wikipedia (quite the contrary, it can be an excellent resource for a quick orientation to a topic), but we do need to be critical consumers of such material. Moreover, it does nothing for your learning to cut and paste bits from the many sites that will recycle information about our subject matter. More so than in years past, the tempting online fodder for plagiarism is right where where we are spending our days and nights. It’s there on the phone just a few clicks away. As no technological solution is foolproof, the best (albeit imperfect) measure is to make plagiarism so unappealing and make it so potentially disastrous to commit academic fraud that the risks far outweigh any potential gains.

*Definition of Plagiarism*
	
Plagiarism is the use of other people's words or ideas without clear acknowledgment of the source. Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and a violation of the FSU Honor Code (see below). In written work submitted for this course, if you use any ideas or words from another source then you must properly credit that source with a footnote or a parenthetical citation. For example: 1. 'While some may cling to the old-fashioned notion that "the force will be with you, always" (Kenobi 1977, 35), scholars have shown that the force is in fact a Derridean absence of paternity mixed with a Lacanian projection of lightsabertude'. Note too that even if you do not use the exact words but only the idea, you must provide citation: e.g. The force will be there at all times (Kenobi 1977, 35). You must provide citations for both paraphrase and direct quotation. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism or how to use appropriate citation, please contact me.


A better way to think about plagiarism: The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to stop worrying about “avoiding” plagiarism. You do not need to hide the fact that you looked to another source for knowledge or inspiration. But you do need to be clear about where your information is coming from. Footnotes and citations are a form of "showing your work". When you write and have done some work reviewing primary and, if necessary, secondary sources, when you go to write the paper it does not (or, at least, should not) emerge out of thin air (so-called "BS"); rather, you put in order and bring together relevant items from what you have read in order to present your own argument. Citation of your sources allows you to show-off the work you have done. In showing your work, you also give your reader the opportunity to follow the same path you have and to understand clearly how you arrived at your conclusion. Citing sources is, above all, an essential part of making a convincing argument.


For each assertion, ask “How do I know that?” If the answer is that it came from something your read or saw, then cite where you got it from.


Bottom Line: Your own rushed last minute or late writing is preferable to trying to pass off another source as your own. It is not worth the risk.
